        <p>Everybody knows my name now <br>
            But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange <br>
            Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself <br>
            And seein' somebody else <br>
            And everything is not the same now <br>
            It feels like all our lives have changed <br>
            Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down <br>
            But it's killin' me now <br>
            What if you had it all <br>
            But nobody to call? <br>
            Maybe then you'd know me <br>
            'Cause I've had everything <br>
            But no one's listening <br>
            And that's just lonely <br>
            I'm so lonely <br>
            Lonely <br>
            Everybody knows my past now <br>
            Like my house was always made of glass <br>
            And maybe that's the price you pay <br>
            For the money and fame at an early age <br>
            And everybody saw me sick <br>
            And it felt like no one gave <br>
            They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid <br>
            What if you had it all <br>
            But nobody to call? <br>
            Maybe then you'd know me <br>
            'Cause I've had everything <br>
            But no one's listening <br>
            And that's just lonely <br>
            I'm so lonely <br>
            Lonely <br>
            I'm so lonely <br>
            Lonely</p>
